It was smooth sailing, and I'm enjoying building with Astro. And, the [Discord community](https://astro.build/chat) is really friendly and helpful! Do join this great community and show case what you build.

How did I do it? Aimed for the Moon and landed among the stars? Nah, I aimed for the stars directly!
