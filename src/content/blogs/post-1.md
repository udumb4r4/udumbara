Welcome to my _new blog_ about space exploration! Here, I will share my learning journey about the universe around us.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up this project.

2. **Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.

Whew! That felt like taking a long walk on Mars! ðŸŸ
